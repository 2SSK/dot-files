# Clipper Plugin - Comprehensive Changelog

## Version 2.4.4 (2026-04-26)

### Critical data-loss fix: notecards never reached disk

If you lost a notecard between v2.4.3 and v2.4.4 — I'm sorry. This was my fault. The "atomic write" hotfix shipped in v2.4.3 turned out to be **silently broken** on noctalia-qs and similar Quickshell builds: `Quickshell.execDetached(["sh", "-c", script, ...])` with the multi-arg shell pipeline never actually executed the script. Every `saveNoteCard()` call returned successfully, the note appeared in the panel UI, and a "Note created" toast was shown — but the file never landed in `~/.config/noctalia/plugins/clipper/notecards/`. On the next panel open, `loadNoteCards` saw nothing and the note was gone.

The same path was used for `pinned.json` and notecard `.txt` exports, so those could vanish too under the same conditions.

#### Root cause

- `Quickshell.execDetached` with `["sh", "-c", script, "$0", "$1", "$2", "$3"]` (where `$3` was a long base64 string) silently no-ops in noctalia-qs 0.0.x. The simpler 2–3 argv calls (`mkdir -p`, `find ... -delete`) work; the long-argv save path does not. There is no error, no log, no partial file — the script never starts.
- `loadNoteCards` used `jq -s '.' *.json 2>/dev/null || echo '[]'`, which is **all-or-nothing**: a single 0-byte or malformed file in the directory made jq exit non-zero, the fallback returned an empty array, and the in-memory `noteCards` was wiped — making every other note invisible in the UI even though it was intact on disk.

#### Fix

- **New atomic-write engine.** Replaced `Quickshell.execDetached` + base64 with a queued `Process` that pipes the raw payload to `sh -c 'cat > "$1.tmp" && [ -s "$1.tmp" ] && mv -f "$1.tmp" "$1" && { [ -z "$2" ] || [ "$2" = "$1" ] || rm -f "$2"; } || { rm -f "$1.tmp"; exit 1; }'` via stdin. Process gives us a real exit code and stderr, so genuine failures are now logged via `Logger.w` instead of vanishing. The queue serializes saves because Process is single-instance.
- **Resilient loader.** `loadNoteCards` now validates each `*.json` file individually with `jq -e .` and concatenates only the valid ones into the slurp. A single corrupt or 0-byte file no longer wipes the rest. The `onExited` handler also stops blanking `noteCards` on shell errors or empty results — when the disk read gives nothing useful, in-memory state is preserved instead of cleared.
- **No more base64.** Payload travels through stdin, so Polish / Cyrillic / emoji titles and content survive verbatim without escaping concerns. The `stringToBase64` helper and the `atomicWriteBase64` shim are gone.

Applied to `savePinnedFile`, `saveNoteCard`, `updateNoteCard`, and `exportNoteCard`. Tested by reproducing the disappearing-notecard case (rename + reopen panel) on noctalia-qs 0.0.12 — pre-fix: file vanished; post-fix: file persists across restarts.

If you can still reproduce a disappearance, please open an issue with `grep Clipper /run/user/$(id -u)/quickshell/by-id/*/log.log | tail -40`. The `atomicWrite FAIL` lines now carry exit code and stderr.

## Version 2.4.3 (2026-04-22)

### Data-loss hotfix: atomic writes for pinned items and notecards

Fixes a data-loss bug that could silently destroy pinned items (`pinned.json`) or individual notecards (`notecards/*.json`) under rare timing conditions. A 0-byte ghost file left on disk was traced back to three compounding issues in the save path:

1. **Non-atomic shell redirection.** All writes used `base64 -d > "$file"`, which opens the target with `O_TRUNC` **before** decoding and writing. If the process was interrupted between truncate and write (shell restart, kill, OOM, base64 failure), the file was left at 0 bytes with no recovery possible.
2. **Rename race in `updateNoteCard`.** When a note's title changed, the old file was deleted via a parallel `rm` `execDetached` call issued alongside the new `saveNoteCard`. If the `rm` completed but the save failed, the note vanished entirely.
3. **Empty-base64 edge case.** If `stringToBase64()` returned an empty string (e.g. from a malformed note object), the shell pipeline still truncated the target, producing a guaranteed 0-byte file.

**Fix:** new `atomicWriteBase64(filePath, base64, oldFilePath)` helper in `Main.qml`:

- Writes to a temp file (`<file>.tmp`) first, verifies it is non-empty (`[ -s "$t" ]`), then atomically renames over the target with `mv -f`.
- Only removes the old file **after** the new file is safely in place (and only when the old path differs from the new path).
- Passes `filePath`, `oldFilePath`, and `base64` via argv (not string interpolation) — shell-injection safe and robust against filenames with spaces/quotes.
- Refuses empty writes up front (`base64.length === 0`) and logs a warning instead of truncating the target.
- `saveNoteCard` now validates `note.id` and `JSON.stringify` length ≥ 10 before writing.

Applied to `savePinnedFile`, `saveNoteCard`, `updateNoteCard`, and `exportNoteCard`.

Also: `Component.onCompleted` now sweeps any stale `*.json.tmp` files left over from previous interrupted writes, so a crash mid-hotfix cannot leak temp files indefinitely.

## Version 2.4.2 (2026-04-22)

### Fix ReferenceError on plugin teardown

- Removed a dead `wlCopyProc` reference in `Component.onDestruction` (`Main.qml`) that threw `ReferenceError: wlCopyProc is not defined` when the panel or shell was torn down. The id was left over from an earlier refactor; wl-copy usage already lives in `copyToClipboardProc` and direct `Quickshell.execDetached(["wl-copy", ...])` calls, so no replacement logic is needed.

## Version 2.4.1 (2026-04-21)

### Fix Qt.btoa deprecation warnings

- Replaced three deprecated `Qt.btoa(string)` calls in `Main.qml` (`savePinnedFile`, `exportNoteCard`, `saveNoteCard`) with a new `stringToBase64(str)` helper that encodes the string to UTF-8 bytes as a `Uint8Array` and passes it to the non-deprecated `Qt.btoa(array-like)` overload.
- Simplified the matching `Qt.atob()` call: the array-like overload returns a `Uint8Array` directly, so the intermediate string + `charCodeAt` loop was removed.
- Side benefit: `exportNoteCard()` now writes properly encoded UTF-8 `.txt` files — previously, notes containing non-ASCII characters (Polish, emoji, Cyrillic, etc.) were written with Latin-1 byte encoding.
- No behavior change for existing `pinned.json` / `notecards/*.json` files: `JSON.stringify` already escapes non-ASCII to `\uNNNN`, so the base64 output is effectively identical for ASCII-safe JSON.

## Version 2.4.0 (2026-04-20)

### Live-Preview Settings, Panel Size Controls, i18n Cleanup

**Settings live-preview with revert-on-cancel:**
- All settings changes apply immediately as a live preview via `_applyPreview()`
- Snapshot taken on `Component.onCompleted`; reverted on `Component.onDestruction` if user cancels (Apply not clicked)
- `saveSettings()` sets `_applied = true` to suppress revert

**New panel size controls (Appearance tab):**
- `NSpinBox` for panel width (400–3840 px, step 50) — hidden in fullscreen mode
- `NSpinBox` for panel height (0–2160 px, step 50, 0 = auto) — hidden in fullscreen mode
- `Panel.qml` now reads `panelWidth`/`panelHeight` from settings instead of hardcoded 1450

**Hide Panel Background gating:**
- "Hide Panel Background" toggle and its divider are now hidden when NoteCards are enabled

**i18n cleanup:**
- Removed all `|| "fallback"` suffixes from `pluginApi?.tr()` calls across all 11 QML files
- Added 4 new translation keys (`panel-width`, `panel-width-desc`, `panel-height`, `panel-height-desc`) to all 17 language files

**manifest.json:**
- Version bumped to `2.4.0`
- Added `defaultSettings`: `fullscreenMode`, `hidePanelBackground`, `autoPaste`, `autoPasteOnRightClick`, `autoPasteDelay`, `panelWidth`, `panelHeight`, `cardColors`, `customColors`

---

## Architecture Improvements

### 1. Removal of ClipboardService.qml
**Impact:** High - Simplified architecture

**Rationale:**
- Eliminated unnecessary abstraction layer
- Reduced IPC overhead
- Direct function calls from Panel.qml to Main.qml
- Better memory management

**Migration:**
- All ClipboardService functions moved to Main.qml
- Panel uses `pluginApi?.mainInstance?.functionName()` pattern
- Removed internal IPC calls (anti-pattern per guidelines)

**Functions Integrated:**
- list(), copyToClipboard(), deleteById(), wipeAll()
- pinItem(), unpinItem(), copyPinnedToClipboard()
- decodeToDataUrl(), getItemType()
- addTodoWithText(), showTodoPageSelector()

---

### 2. Security Enhancements
**Impact:** Critical - Prevented command injection vulnerabilities

**Fixes:**
- Input validation with regex `/^\d+$/` for all clipboard IDs
- Shell command parameters properly escaped
- Qt.btoa() for safe base64 encoding (no shell metacharacters)
- Process stdin used instead of shell interpolation
- File paths are constant, not user-controlled

**Vulnerable Patterns Fixed:**
```qml
// BEFORE (v1.1.0 - VULNERABLE)
Quickshell.execDetached(["sh", "-c", "cliphist decode " + id + " | wl-copy"])

// AFTER (v1.3.1 - SECURE)
if (!/^\d+$/.test(String(id))) {
    Logger.e("clipper", "Invalid clipboard ID: " + id);
    return;
}
copyToClipboardProc.command = ["cliphist", "decode", String(id)];
copyToClipboardProc.running = true;
```

**Protected Functions:**
- pinItem(), deleteById(), copyToClipboard(), decodeToDataUrl()

---

### 3. Memory Management
**Impact:** Medium - Leak prevention

**Improvements:**
- Main.qml: Comprehensive cleanup of 11 Process objects
- TodoPageSelector.qml: Timer cleanup on destruction
- LRU cache with automatic eviction (maxImageCacheSize: 50)
- clearCaches() function for wipe operations

**Component.onDestruction Added:**
```qml
// Main.qml
Component.onDestruction: {
    if (listProc.running) listProc.terminate();
    if (decodeProc.running) decodeProc.terminate();
    // ... 9 more processes
}

// TodoPageSelector.qml
Component.onDestruction: {
    showMenuTimer.stop();
    close();
}
```

---

### 4. IPC Interface Cleanup
**Impact:** Medium - Cleaner external API

**Simplified IPC:**
- Removed 9 numbered functions: `addToTodo1()` through `addToTodo9()`
- Removed generic `addToTodo(pageId: int)`
- Removed `addTextToTodo(text, pageId)` (now internal-only)
- Renamed `addToTodoWithSelector()` → `addSelectionToTodo()`

**Retained Essential IPC:**
```qml
function toggle()              // Required for keybind compatibility
function openPanel()
function closePanel()
function togglePanel()
function pinClipboardItem(cliphistId: string)
function unpinItem(pinnedId: string)
function copyPinned(pinnedId: string)
function addSelectionToTodo()  // NEW - replaced 9+ functions
```

---

## UI/UX Improvements

### 1. Panel Layout Redesign
**Impact:** High - Better space utilization

**Changes:**
- Fullscreen transparent overlay (replaces anchored panel)
- Two sub-panels: Pinned (left, vertical) + Clipboard (bottom, horizontal)
- Pinned panel: 300px width (max 20% screen width)
- Clipboard panel: 300px height (max 30% screen height)
- Click outside panels to close

**Removed Animations:**
- Eliminated `populate`, `add`, `remove`, `displaced`, `move` transitions
- Instant card appearance/disappearance
- No sliding animations on delete
- Improved perceived performance

**Benefits:**
- Always-visible pinned items
- More horizontal space for clipboard cards
- Better multi-monitor support (fullscreen overlay)

---

### 2. ClipboardCard Enhancements
**Impact:** Medium - Better usability

**Visual Improvements:**
- Pin indicator icon in top-right corner (for pinned items)
- Unified color scheme (background = header = body)
- Gradient separator between header and content
- Hover effects with color lightening/darkening

**Interactive Elements:**
- ToDo button now shows context menu (page selection)
- Pin button hidden for already-pinned items
- Delete button always visible
- Tooltips added for all action buttons

**Type Detection:**
- Enhanced regex patterns for better content classification
- Support for: Text, Image, Link, Code, Color, Emoji, File paths

---

### 3. Settings UI Redesign
**Impact:** High - Professional appearance

**Layout:**
- Section headers with bold large font
- NDivider separators between sections
- Logical grouping: Integrations, Pinned Items, Appearance

**New Components:**
- Card type selector dropdown
- Live preview rectangle with sample card
- 3-level color customization (bg, separator, fg)
- RGB color pickers with Material Design palette
- Reset to defaults button

**Removed:**
- "Auto-open pinned panel" toggle (always-on design)
- "Clear All Pinned Items" button (use individual delete)

---

## Performance Optimizations

### 1. Image Caching Strategy
**Implementation:**
- LRU (Least Recently Used) cache
- Max 50 images in memory
- Automatic eviction of oldest entries
- Reactive binding via `imageCacheRevision` counter

**Cache Operations:**
```qml
function addToImageCache(cliphistId, dataUrl) {
    // Remove if exists (will re-add at end)
    // Evict oldest if at capacity
    while (imageCacheOrder.length >= maxImageCacheSize) {
        const oldestKey = imageCacheOrder[0];
        // Remove from cache
    }
    // Add new entry
    imageCacheRevision++; // Trigger reactive updates
}
```

**Benefits:**
- Reduced cliphist decode calls (expensive operation)
- Faster card rendering for previously-seen images
- Bounded memory usage

---

### 2. Removed Animations
**Impact:** Medium - Faster perceived performance

**Removed Transitions:**
- `populate`: Initial list population
- `add`: New item insertion
- `remove`: Item deletion (was sliding left)
- `displaced`: Item repositioning
- `move`: Item movement

**Result:**
- Instant feedback on delete operations
- No visual lag during filtering
- Cleaner appearance during rapid changes

---

## Bug Fixes

### 1. Command Injection Vulnerabilities (CRITICAL)
**GitHub v1.1.0 Issue:**
```qml
// Vulnerable to shell injection
Quickshell.execDetached(["sh", "-c", "cliphist decode " + id + " | wl-copy"])
```

**Local v1.3.1 Fix:**
```qml
// Input validation + proper command array
if (!/^\d+$/.test(String(id))) {
    Logger.e("clipper", "Invalid clipboard ID");
    return;
}
copyToClipboardProc.command = ["cliphist", "decode", String(id)];
```

---

### 2. Internal IPC Anti-Pattern (HIGH)
**GitHub v1.1.0 Issue:**
```qml
// Panel.qml calling its own plugin via IPC (anti-pattern)
Process {
    command: ["qs", "ipc", "call", "plugin:clipper", "addTextToTodo", ...]
}
```

**Local v1.3.1 Fix:**
```qml
// Direct function call
pluginApi?.mainInstance?.addTodoWithText(text, pageId);
```

---

### 3. Memory Leaks in Process Objects
**GitHub v1.1.0 Issue:**
- No cleanup handlers for Process objects
- Processes continue running after component destruction

**Local v1.3.1 Fix:**
```qml
Component.onDestruction: {
    if (listProc.running) listProc.terminate();
    if (decodeProc.running) decodeProc.terminate();
    // ... all 11 processes terminated
}
```

---

### 4. Multi-Monitor Support Issues
**Remaining Issue in v1.3.1:**
```qml
// Still uses Quickshell.screens[0] - should use withCurrentScreen()
function toggle() {
    const screens = Quickshell.screens;
    if (screens && screens.length > 0) {
        pluginApi.togglePanel(screens[0]);  // Always first screen
    }
}
```

**Recommended Fix:**
```qml
function toggle() {
    if (pluginApi) {
        pluginApi.withCurrentScreen(screen => {
            pluginApi.togglePanel(screen);
        });
    }
}
```

## Testing Recommendations

### Critical Test Cases:
1. **Security:** Attempt clipboard ID injection: `12345; rm -rf /`
2. **Multi-Monitor:** Test toggle on non-primary screen
3. **Memory:** Monitor RSS after 100+ clipboard operations
4. **Pinned Items:** Test 20-item limit enforcement
5. **ToDo Integration:** Test with ToDo plugin disabled
6. **Image Caching:** Verify LRU eviction after 51 images
7. **Translation:** Test all 16 language files load correctly
8. **Color Customization:** Test custom RGB → save → reload

### Performance Benchmarks:
- Initial load time: < 500ms
- Image decode & cache: < 200ms per image
- Panel open latency: < 100ms
- Search filter response: < 50ms

## Migration Guide (v1.1.0 → v1.3.1)

### For Users:
1. **Backup existing clipboard data** (cliphist database)
2. Update plugin files
3. Restart Noctalia Shell
4. Configure ToDo integration in Settings (if using ToDo plugin)
5. Customize card colors if desired
6. Update keybinds (if using removed `addToTodo1-9` functions)

### For Developers:
1. **Remove ClipboardService.qml** - functionality in Main.qml
2. **Update IPC calls** - use new `addSelectionToTodo` instead of numbered functions
3. **Test pinned items** - new persistent storage in `pinned.json`
4. **Verify translations** - all strings now use `pluginApi?.tr()`
5. **Check multi-monitor** - potential issue with screen detection

### Breaking Changes:
- ClipboardService.qml removed (use Main.qml functions)
- IPC functions `addToTodo1-9` removed (use context menu or `addSelectionToTodo`)
- Settings structure changed (new color customization fields)
- Panel layout changed (fullscreen overlay vs anchored panel)

---

## Known Issues & Future Work

### Current Issues (v1.3.1):
1. **[HIGH]** Multi-monitor: IpcHandler uses `screens[0]` instead of `withCurrentScreen()`
2. **[MEDIUM]** Duplicated code: getTodoPages() in TodoPageSelector.qml and ClipboardCard.qml
3. **[MEDIUM]** Magic numbers: Hardcoded dimensions (250px, 300px, etc.)
4. **[LOW]** Panel.qml.backup tracked in git (should be in .gitignore)
5. **[LOW]** .gitignore file deleted (should be restored)

### Planned Features (v1.4.0+):
- [ ] Configurable history limit (50-500 items)
- [ ] Image preview size limit setting
- [ ] Export/import pinned items
- [ ] Clipboard sync across devices
- [ ] Smart categorization using AI
- [ ] Clipboard statistics dashboard
