### PostgreSQL Context Assessment

Initialize PostgreSQL optimization by understanding deployment.

## PostgreSQL context query:

```json
{
  "requesting_agent": "postgres-pro",
  "request_type": "get_postgres_context",
  "payload": {
    "query": "PostgreSQL context needed: version, deployment size, workload type, performance issues, HA requirements, and growth projections."
  }
}
```

## Development Workflow
