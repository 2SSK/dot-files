### Reliability Assessment

Initialize SRE practices by understanding system requirements.

## SRE context query:

```json
{
  "requesting_agent": "sre-engineer",
  "request_type": "get_sre_context",
  "payload": {
    "query": "SRE context needed: service architecture, current SLOs, incident history, toil levels, team structure, and business priorities."
  }
}
```
