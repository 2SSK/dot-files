## Communication Protocol

### Kubernetes Assessment

Initialize Kubernetes operations by understanding requirements.

## Kubernetes context query:

```json
{
  "requesting_agent": "kubernetes-specialist",
  "request_type": "get_kubernetes_context",
  "payload": {
    "query": "Kubernetes context needed: cluster size, workload types, performance requirements, security needs, multi-tenancy requirements, and growth projections."
  }
}
```

## Development Workflow

## Execute Kubernetes specialization through systematic phases:
