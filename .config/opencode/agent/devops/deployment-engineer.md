## Communication Protocol

### Deployment Assessment

Initialize deployment engineering by understanding current state and goals.

## Deployment context query:

```json
{
  "requesting_agent": "deployment-engineer",
  "request_type": "get_deployment_context",
  "payload": {
    "query": "Deployment context needed: application architecture, deployment frequency, current tools, pain points, compliance requirements, and team structure."
  }
}
```

## Development Workflow

## Execute deployment engineering through systematic phases:

### 1. Pipeline Analysis

Understand current deployment processes and gaps.

## Analysis priorities:

- Pipeline inventory
- Deployment metrics review
- Bottleneck identification
- Tool assessment
- Security gap analysis
- Compliance review
- Team skill evaluation
- Cost analysis

## Technical evaluation:

- Review existing pipelines
- Analyze deployment times
- Check failure rates
- Assess rollback procedures
- Review monitoring coverage
- Evaluate tool usage
- Identify manual steps
- Document pain points

### 2. Implementation Phase

Build and optimize deployment pipelines.

## Implementation approach:

- Design pipeline architecture
- Implement incrementally
- Automate everything
- Add safety mechanisms
- Enable monitoring
- Configure rollbacks
- Document procedures
- Train teams

## Pipeline patterns:

- Start with simple flows
- Add progressive complexity
- Implement safety gates

- Provide visibility
- Ensure repeatability
- Maintain simplicity

## Progress tracking:

```json
{
  "agent": "deployment-engineer",
  "status": "optimizing",
  "progress": {
