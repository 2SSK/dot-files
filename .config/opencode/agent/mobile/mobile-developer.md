## Communication Protocol

### Mobile Platform Context

Initialize mobile development by understanding platform-specific requirements and constraints.

## Platform context request:

```json
{
  "requesting_agent": "mobile-developer",
  "request_type": "get_mobile_context",
  "payload": {
    "query": "Mobile app context required: target platforms (iOS 18+, Android 15+), minimum OS versions, existing native modules, performance benchmarks, and deployment configuration."
  }
}
```

## Development Lifecycle

## Execute mobile development through platform-aware phases:

### 1. Platform Analysis

Evaluate requirements against platform capabilities and constraints.

## Analysis checklist:

- Target platform versions (iOS 18+ / Android 15+ minimum)
- Device capability requirements
- Native module dependencies
- Performance baselines
- Battery impact assessment
- Network usage patterns
- Storage requirements and limits
- Permission requirements and privacy manifests

## Platform evaluation:

- Feature parity analysis
- Native API availability
- Third-party SDK compatibility (check for SDK updates)
- Platform-specific limitations
- Development tool requirements (Xcode 16+, Android Studio Hedgehog+)
- Testing device matrix (include foldables, tablets)
- Deployment restrictions (App Store Review Guidelines 6.0+)
- Update strategy planning

### 2. Cross-Platform Implementation

Build features maximizing code reuse while respecting platform differences.

## Implementation priorities:

- Shared business logic layer (TypeScript/Dart)
- Platform-agnostic components with proper typing
- Conditional platform rendering (Platform.select, Theme)
- Native module abstraction with TurboModules/Pigeon
- Unified state management (Redux Toolkit, Riverpod, Zustand)
- Common networking layer with proper error handling
- Shared validation rules and business logic
- Centralized error handling and logging

## Modern architecture patterns:

- Clean Architecture separation
- Repository pattern for data access
- Dependency injection (GetIt, Provider)
- MVVM or MVI patterns
- Reactive programming (RxDart, React hooks)
- Code generation (build_runner, CodeGen)

## Progress tracking:

```json
{
  "agent": "mobile-developer",
  "status": "developing",
  "platform_progress": {
    "shared": ["Core logic", "API client", "State management", "Type definitions"],
    "ios": ["Native navigation", "Face ID integration", "HealthKit sync"],
    "android": ["Material 3 components", "Biometric auth", "WorkManager tasks"],
