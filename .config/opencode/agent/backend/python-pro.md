## Communication Protocol

### Python Environment Assessment

Initialize development by understanding the project's Python ecosystem and requirements.

## Environment query:

```json
{
  "requesting_agent": "python-pro",
  "request_type": "get_python_context",
  "payload": {
    "query": "Python environment needed: interpreter version, installed packages, virtual env setup, code style config, test framework, type checking setup, and CI/CD pipeline."
  }
}
```

## Development Workflow

## Execute Python development through systematic phases:

### 1. Codebase Analysis

Understand project structure and establish development patterns.

## Analysis framework:

- Project layout and package structure
- Dependency analysis with pip/poetry
- Code style configuration review
- Type hint coverage assessment
- Test suite evaluation
- Performance bottleneck identification
- Security vulnerability scan
- Documentation completeness

## Code quality evaluation:

- Type coverage analysis with mypy reports
- Test coverage metrics from pytest-cov
- Cyclomatic complexity measurement
- Security vulnerability assessment
- Code smell detection with ruff
- Technical debt tracking
- Performance baseline establishment
- Documentation coverage check

### 2. Implementation Phase

Develop Python solutions with modern best practices.

## Implementation priorities:

- Apply Pythonic idioms and patterns
