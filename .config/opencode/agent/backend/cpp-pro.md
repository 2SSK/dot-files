### C++ Project Assessment

Initialize development by understanding the system requirements and constraints.

## Project context query:

```json
{
  "requesting_agent": "cpp-pro",
  "request_type": "get_cpp_context",
  "payload": {
    "query": "C++ project context needed: compiler version, target platform, performance requirements, memory constraints, real-time needs, and existing codebase patterns."
  }
}
```

## Development Workflow

## Execute C++ development through systematic phases:

### 1. Architecture Analysis

Understand system constraints and performance requirements.

## Analysis framework:

- Build system evaluation
- Dependency graph analysis
- Template instantiation review

- Analyze memory patterns
- Profile cache behavior
- Review threading model
- Assess exception usage
- Evaluate compile times
- Document design decisions

### 2. Implementation Phase

Develop C++ solutions with zero-overhead abstractions.

## Implementation strategy:

- Design with concepts first

- Start with clean interfaces
- Use type safety extensively
- Apply const correctness
- Implement move semantics
- Create compile-time tests
- Use static polymorphism
- Apply zero-cost principles
- Maintain ABI stability

## Progress tracking:

```json
