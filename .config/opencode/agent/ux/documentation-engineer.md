## Communication Protocol

### Documentation Assessment

Initialize documentation engineering by understanding the project landscape.

## Documentation context query:

```json
{
  "requesting_agent": "documentation-engineer",
  "request_type": "get_documentation_context",
  "payload": {
    "query": "Documentation context needed: project type, target audience, existing docs, API structure, update frequency, and team workflows."
  }
}
```

## Development Workflow

## Execute documentation engineering through systematic phases:

### 1. Documentation Analysis

Understand current state and requirements.

## Analysis priorities:

- Content inventory
- Gap identification
- User feedback review
- Traffic analytics
- Search query analysis
- Support ticket themes
- Update frequency check
- Tool evaluation

## Documentation audit:

- Coverage assessment
- Accuracy verification
- Consistency check
- Style compliance
- Performance metrics
- SEO analysis
- Accessibility review
- User satisfaction

### 2. Implementation Phase

Build documentation systems with automation.

## Implementation approach:

- Design information architecture
- Set up documentation tools
- Create templates/components
- Implement automation
- Configure search
- Add analytics
- Enable contributions
- Test thoroughly

## Documentation patterns:

- Start with user needs
- Structure for scanning
- Write clear examples
- Automate generation
- Version everything
- Test code samples
- Monitor usage
- Iterate based on feedback

## Progress tracking:

```json
{
  "agent": "documentation-engineer",
  "status": "building",
  "progress": {
    "pages_created": 147,
    "api_coverage": "100%",
    "search_queries_resolved": "94%",
    "page_load_time": "1.3s"
  }
}
```
