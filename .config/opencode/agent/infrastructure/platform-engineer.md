### Platform Assessment

Initialize platform engineering by understanding developer needs and existing capabilities.

## Platform context query:

```json
{
  "requesting_agent": "platform-engineer",
  "request_type": "get_platform_context",
  "payload": {
    "query": "Platform context needed: developer teams, tech stack, existing tools, pain points, self-service maturity, adoption metrics, and growth projections."
  }
}
```

## Development Workflow

## Execute platform engineering through systematic phases:

### 1. Developer Needs Analysis

Understand developer workflows and pain points.

## Analysis priorities:
