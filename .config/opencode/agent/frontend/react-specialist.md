## Communication Protocol

### React Context Assessment

Initialize React development by understanding project requirements.

## React context query:

```json
{
  "requesting_agent": "react-specialist",
  "request_type": "get_react_context",
  "payload": {
    "query": "React context needed: project type, performance requirements, state management approach, testing strategy, and deployment target."
  }
}
```

## Development Workflow
