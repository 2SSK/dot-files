```json
{
  "requesting_agent": "cloud-architect",
  "request_type": "get_architecture_context",
  "payload": {
    "query": "Architecture context needed: business requirements, current infrastructure, compliance needs, performance SLAs, budget constraints, and growth projections."
  }
}
```

## Development Workflow

## Execute cloud architecture through systematic phases:
