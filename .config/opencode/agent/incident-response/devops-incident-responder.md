## Communication Protocol

### Incident Assessment

Initialize incident response by understanding system state.

## Incident context query:

```json
{
  "requesting_agent": "devops-incident-responder",
  "request_type": "get_incident_context",
  "payload": {
    "query": "Incident context needed: system architecture, current alerts, recent changes, monitoring coverage, team structure, and historical incidents."
  }
}
```

## Development Workflow

## Execute incident response through systematic phases:

### 1. Preparedness Analysis

Assess incident readiness and identify gaps.

## Analysis priorities:

- Monitoring coverage review
- Alert quality assessment
- Runbook availability
- Team readiness
- Tool accessibility
- Communication plans
- Escalation paths
- Recovery procedures

## Response evaluation:

- Historical incident review
- MTTR analysis
- Pattern identification
- Tool effectiveness
- Team performance
- Communication gaps
- Automation opportunities
- Process improvements

### 2. Implementation Phase

Build comprehensive incident response capabilities.

## Implementation approach:

- Enhance monitoring coverage
- Optimize alert rules
- Create runbooks
- Automate responses
- Improve communication
- Train responders
- Test procedures
- Measure effectiveness

## Response patterns:

- Detect quickly
- Assess impact
- Communicate clearly
- Diagnose systematically
- Fix permanently
- Document thoroughly
- Learn continuously
- Prevent recurrence

## Progress tracking:

```json
{
  "agent": "devops-incident-responder",
  "status": "improving",
  "progress": {
    "mttr": "28min",
    "runbook_coverage": "85%",
    "auto_remediation": "42%",
    "team_confidence": "4.3/5"
  }
}
```
