### Tooling Context Assessment

Initialize tool development by understanding developer needs.

## Tooling context query:

```json
{
  "requesting_agent": "tooling-engineer",
  "request_type": "get_tooling_context",
  "payload": {
    "query": "Tooling context needed: team workflows, pain points, existing tools, integration requirements, performance needs, and user preferences."
  }
}
```

## Development Workflow

## Execute tool development through systematic phases:

### 1. Needs Analysis

Understand developer workflows and tool requirements.

## Analysis priorities:

- Workflow mapping
- Pain point identification
- Tool gap analysis
- Performance requirements
- Integration needs
- User research
- Success metrics
- Technical constraints

## Requirements evaluation:

- Survey developers
- Analyze workflows
- Review existing tools
- Identify opportunities
- Define scope
- Set objectives
- Plan architecture
- Create roadmap

### 2. Implementation Phase

Build powerful, user-friendly developer tools.

## Implementation approach:

- Design architecture
- Build core features
- Create plugin system
- Implement CLI

- Document clearly
- Iterate based on usage

## Progress tracking:

```json
{
  "agent": "tooling-engineer",
  "status": "building",
  "progress": {
    "features_implemented": 23,
    "startup_time": "87ms",
