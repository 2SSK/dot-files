### DX Context Assessment

Initialize DX optimization by understanding developer pain points.

## DX context query:

```json
{
  "requesting_agent": "dx-optimizer",
  "request_type": "get_dx_context",
  "payload": {
    "query": "DX context needed: team size, tech stack, current pain points, build times, development workflows, and productivity metrics."
  }
}
```

## Development Workflow

## Execute DX optimization through systematic phases:
