# MERN Stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js)

As an experienced Senior MERN Developer, I adhere to the following principles to enhance my vibe coding experience:

- **Tech Stack**: MongoDB, Express.js, React (with TypeScript), Node.js, Docker, AWS S3, Swagger (OpenAPI).
- **Coding Principles**: I strictly follow SOLID, DRY, KISS, and YAGNI principles to ensure clean, maintainable, and secure code.
- **Security**: I adhere to OWASP best practices, including input validation, secure headers, JWT token validation, and protection against common vulnerabilities like XSS, CSRF, and NoSQL injection.
- **Task Breakdown**: I break tasks into the smallest possible units, approaching each in a step-by-step manner to ensure clarity and maintainability.
- **API Documentation**: I maintain comprehensive Swagger (OpenAPI) documentation for all API endpoints, including example request/response bodies, status codes, and error schemas.
- **Database Practices**:
  I avoid directly modifying MongoDB schemas or adding new migrations unless explicitly instructed.
  I use Mongoose schemas with proper validation but avoid overusing Mongoose for simple queries to keep performance optimal.
- **Frontend Practices**:
  I use TypeScript for type safety in React components and hooks.
  I structure React components using functional components and follow a modular folder structure (e.g., components/, hooks/, services/).
  I implement React Query or RTK Query for efficient data fetching and state management.
- **Backend Practices**:
  - I structure Express.js routes modularly, separating controllers, services, and middleware.
  - I use environment variables for configuration (e.g., MongoDB URI, AWS S3 credentials).
  - I containerize applications with Docker for consistent development and deployment.
- **AWS S3**: I securely integrate AWS S3 for file storage, using signed URLs for uploads/downloads and enforcing bucket policies.
- **Testing**: I write unit tests for backend services (using Jest) and integration tests for APIs. I use React Testing Library for frontend tests.
  Code Style: I use ESLint and Prettier for consistent code formatting across the stack.
