#+title: What is "System Crafting?"

* What's in a name?

- A name to describe computer configuration enthusiasts
- The act, or craft, of creating and refining your computing environment
- You're probably here because you are inclined toward this (Emacs)

Let's go into more detail about what it means!

* Why do it?

- Satisfaction of learning something new, being creative
- Building an environment tailored to the way you think and work
- Express your aesthetics (minimalism, colors, typography)
- Ensuring your freedom and privacy

* All roads lead to GNU/Linux

- Most of us start with mainstream operating systems
- The freedom of the GNU/Linux combo is unmatched
- It gives you a platform for building your ideal environment
- An endless array of programs and tools you can use

* Foundational components

** Linux distribution

- Mainstream, easy to use: Ubuntu, Debian, Fedora, etc
- More technical: Arch (and derivatives), Gentoo
- Functional: NixOS, GNU Guix

** Desktop environment / window manager

- Full environments: GNOME, KDE, XFCE, MATE, LXDE/LXQt, etc
- Window managers: EXWM, i3, Awesome, dwm, bspwm, StumpWM, Openbox, etc

** Editor

- Emacs
- Vim (or derivatives)

Each of these has its own implications on how you might craft your system!

** Miscellaneous

- Mail
- Chat
- Music
- File syncing
- Login managers
- Session managers

* Cultivating and sharing your configuration

- Check in your configuration to source control
- Sharing your configuration with others
- Improving the organization and presentation

* What's the ideal strategy?

- Start wherever you are most comfortable
- Use your tools for a while (at least a month) before trying something else
- Follow good content sources (Twitter, Reddit, Blogs, Videos) for new ideas
- Join communities where people trade ideas

In the future I'll branch out to talk more about alternative system configs and tools so that you have more options to choose from.
