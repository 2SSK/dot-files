#+title: Optimizing Window Placement in EXWM

* Customizing buffer name based on window title

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

  (defun efs/exwm-update-title ()
    (pcase exwm-class-name
      ("Firefox" (exwm-workspace-rename-buffer (format "Firefox: %s" exwm-title)))))

    ;; When window title updates, use it to set the buffer name
    (add-hook 'exwm-update-title-hook #'efs/exwm-update-title)

#+end_src

* Configuring windows when they appear

Use the =exwm-manage-finish-hook=:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

  (defun efs/configure-window-by-class ()
    (interactive)
    (message "Window '%s' appeared!" exwm-class))

    ;; Configure windows as they're created
    (add-hook 'exwm-manage-finish-hook #'efs/configure-window-by-class)

#+end_src

** Sending programs to specific workspaces

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

    (pcase exwm-class-name
      ("Firefox" (exwm-workspace-move-window 2))
      ("Sol" (exwm-workspace-move-window 3))))

#+end_src

** Making windows float automatically

Use the =exwm-floating-toggle-floating= command (=C-c C-t C-f=)

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

      ("mpv" (exwm-floating-toggle-floating))

#+end_src

** Hide the mode line

Use the =exwm-layout-toggle-mode-line= command (=C-c C-t RET=)

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

      ("mpv" (exwm-floating-toggle-floating)
             (exwm-layout-toggle-mode-line))

#+end_src

** Resizing a floating window

- =exwm-layout-enlarge-window[-horizontally]= - Make a window larger by a number of pixels
- =exwm-layout-shrink-window[-horizontally]= - Make a window smaller by a number of pixels
- =frame-pixel-width= / =frame-pixel-height= functions - get pixel width and height of the frame

** Positioning a floating window

- =exwm-floating-move= - Move a window based on a delta
- =x-display-pixel-width= / =x-display-pixel-height= - Get the width and height of the display

** Automatically enter char-mode

- Use =exwm-reset= to toggle back to line-mode (bound to =s-r= in our configuration)
- Use =C-c C-k= (=exwm-input-release-keyboard= to toggle back to char-mode)

* Automatically move windows between workspaces

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

  ;; Automatically move EXWM buffer to current workspace when selected
  (setq exwm-layout-show-all-buffers t)

  ;; Display all EXWM buffers in every workspace buffer list
  (setq exwm-workspace-show-all-buffers t)

#+end_src

* Automatically hiding the minibuffer

EXWM enables you to "detach" the minibuffer so that you can auto-hide it with =exwm-workspace-toggle-minibuffer=:

*NOTE*: You must restart EXWM for this to take effect!

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

    ;; Detach the minibuffer (show it with exwm-workspace-toggle-minibuffer)
    (setq exwm-workspace-minibuffer-position 'bottom)

#+end_src
