#+title: How to Give Presentations with Org Mode
#+author: System Crafters

* Why?

- No need for complicated presentation software
- Impress and/or confuse your coworkers
- Because it's fun!
  
* COMMENT This isn't shown!

This slide won't be shown as part of the presentation because it has a `COMMENT` state.

* Initial Setup

https://github.com/takaxp/org-tree-slide

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

  (use-package org-tree-slide
    :custom
    (org-image-actual-width nil))

#+end_src

Run =org-tree-slide-mode=!
Navigate slides with =C-<= and =C->=

* What Can It Do?

** Display Images

*** System Crafters

I haven't included these images with the notes so you will have to change the link to another image on your computer!  You can do that with =C-c C-l= (=org-insert-link=) and link to the image without adding a description.

#+ATTR_HTML: :width 500
[[file:System Crafters2-01.png]]

*** Emacs

#+ATTR_HTML: :width 300 :height 300
[[file:Emacs.png]]

** Run Code Examples

This is a terrible code snippet for *example purposes only*!

#+begin_src emacs-lisp 

  (let ((output ""))
    (dolist (word '("Emacs" "is" "awesome!"))
            (setq output (concat output word " ")))
    (message (string-trim output)))

#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: Emacs is awesome!

** Countdown Timer

Run =org-tree-slide-play-with-timer= to have a countdown timer appear in your modeline.

Good for keeping track of how much time you have left!

* Profiles

You can run each of these profiles after turning on =org-tree-slide-mode=

** Simple Profile

Run =org-tree-slide-simple-profile=

** Presentation Profile

Run =org-tree-slide-presentation-profile=

** Narrowing Profile

Run =org-tree-slide-narrowing-control-profile=

* Customization

You can also customize everything yourself without using the built-in profiles.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

  (use-package hide-mode-line)

  (defun efs/presentation-setup ()
    ;; Hide the mode line
    (hide-mode-line-mode 1)

    ;; Display images inline
    (org-display-inline-images) ;; Can also use org-startup-with-inline-images

    ;; Scale the text.  The next line is for basic scaling:
    (setq text-scale-mode-amount 3)
    (text-scale-mode 1))

    ;; This option is more advanced, allows you to scale other faces too
    ;; (setq-local face-remapping-alist '((default (:height 2.0) variable-pitch)
    ;;                                    (org-verbatim (:height 1.75) org-verbatim)
    ;;                                    (org-block (:height 1.25) org-block))))

  (defun efs/presentation-end ()
    ;; Show the mode line again
    (hide-mode-line-mode 0)

    ;; Turn off text scale mode (or use the next line if you didn't use text-scale-mode)
    ;; (text-scale-mode 0))

    ;; If you use face-remapping-alist, this clears the scaling:
    (setq-local face-remapping-alist '((default variable-pitch default))))

  (use-package org-tree-slide
    :hook ((org-tree-slide-play . efs/presentation-setup)
           (org-tree-slide-stop . efs/presentation-end))
    :custom
    (org-tree-slide-slide-in-effect t)
    (org-tree-slide-activate-message "Presentation started!")
    (org-tree-slide-deactivate-message "Presentation finished!")
    (org-tree-slide-header t)
    (org-tree-slide-breadcrumbs " > ")
    (org-image-actual-width nil))

* Generating a PDF of Slides

Run =org-beamer-export-to-pdf=, requires =pdflatex= and associated tools though!
