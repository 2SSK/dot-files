#+title: Emacs from Scratch #1

* The plan
We're going to walk through a configuration of Emacs from scratch, starting with the most obvious improvements and then working our way to the more specialized changes as we proceed.

* Brief demo of my config
* Starting off with empty config, make the UI more minimal

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

(use-package command-log-mode)

#+end_src

* Set a theme
* Set up Ivy
